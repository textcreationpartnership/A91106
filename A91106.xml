            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>FRiends, the end of these propositions, certainly is to establish us in a safe and peaceable condition of defence. To preserve our selves and friends, from the invasion of Strangers that dayly threaten us, and to prevent commotions that may arise within our Counties. That our associationâ–ª hath such who will be friend a no longer then oppertunity serve them to shew us, they are our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, our owne experiences c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Suppose we may be invaded by <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Jrish,</hi> then we cannot provide for our owne safety, or suppose we never are disturbed, our labour and charge is not lost, with our Horses we may dayly plough, sow to carriage and all other necessary worke that may be, other charge is little, yea, as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And therefore if these or the like propositions are approved amongst us, as good and necessary for us, then know, we may not let slip this season, to make our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition happie. We have an English Parliament sitting, whose eares are open to heare our desires, and to apply these remedies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

               <p>And although all things are not so well as can be wished, yet the fault thereof, is very much in our selves; we cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how at first we were deceived in our elections, in sending thither such members, whose riches more then vertues we much regarded, and whose actions since hath occasioned much trouble, and hindred many good things from us.</p>
               <p>Yet further, is feared, there are and will remaine more endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and deeper designes under divers colours and specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, if it were possible, to divide and alienate our affections from this honourable Parliament. O let such thoughts never harbour in our minds, but rather let us consider, and (know) that there is no other interest consistent with our welfare, but only that which is now managed by this Parliament, whom we have chosen, and whose preservation with our owne, we so dearly have purchased.</p>

               <p>Let us answer them thus, they may injoy that interest where it is followed, let them thither goe, what makes them here, cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring this English ground? We are English men, and cannot beare any other government, but what is approved by consent to be free, just, and rationall. And for that end is this Parliament cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen: And though our and was crossed by some of our former Trustees, who digging pits for us; are therein fallen: We may hope for the future, it shall admonish us, to be more vigilant and carefull, and as long as justice and judgement, freely passeth amongst us, let us lay aside all delusions of the Enemies of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Rights and liberties and resolve to stand by this Parliament against all opposers whatsoever. And though the face of things seem to change, let us be assured by this Parliament, the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is still maintained, and though designes may be laid in the darke to devide this Parliament and people, yet let us continue firme to the end, as free men borne, free to live and so to dye, and live as doth this honourable Parliament, whom we have intrusted for our preservation.</p>
